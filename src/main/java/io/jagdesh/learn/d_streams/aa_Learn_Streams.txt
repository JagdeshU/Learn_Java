-   Streams
    -   It let us manipulate collections of data in a declarative way.
    -   (i.e) It is used to process collections of objects.

-   In Java Streams, the stream operations are divided into,
    -   Intermediate -- Eg., Stream.filter(), Stream.map()
    -   Terminal -- Eg., Stream.forEach(), Stream.reduce()

-   anyMatch
    -   method is a terminal operation which returns whether any elements of this stream match the provided
        predicate.

-   allMatch
    -   method is a terminal operation, when using this method all the elements must match the given predicate.

-   nonMatch
    -   method is a terminal operation which will return true if no elements  are matched by the predicate, and
        false if one or more elements are matched.

-   collect
    -   this method is a terminal operation that starts the internal iteration of elements and collects the elements
        in the stream in a collection or object of some kind.
